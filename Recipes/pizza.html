    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 cup of warm water</li>
            <li>1 (.25 ounce) package active dry yeast</li>
            <li>1 pinch white sugar</li>
            <li>3 cups all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons kosher salt</li>
            <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
            <li>Â½ cup olive oil</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon minced garlic</li>
            <li>1 quarter cup tomato sauce</li>
            <li>1 cup chopped tomatoes</li>
            <li>1 quarter cup sliced black olives</li>
            <li>1 quarter cup roasted red peppers</li>
            <li>2 cups shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
            <li>4 tablespoons chopped fresh basil</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Directions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Pour warm water into a large bowl; 
            <li>Dissolve yeast and sugar in warm water. Let stand until yeast softens and begins to form a creamy foam, about 5 to 10 minutes.</li>
            <li>Mix in flour, 1 tablespoon olive oil, and salt until dough pulls away from the sides of the bowl.</li>
            <li>Turn onto a lightly floured surface. Knead until smooth, about 8 minutes.</li>
            <li>Place dough in a well-oiled bowl and cover with a damp cloth. Set aside to rise until doubled, about 1 hour.</li>
            <li>Punch down; knead in garlic and basil. Set aside to rise for 1 more hour, or until doubled again.</li>
            <li>Preheat an outdoor grill for high heat.</li>
            <li>Combine 1/2 cup olive oil with minced garlic in a microwave-safe cup or bowl. Heat for 30 seconds in the microwave; set aside.</li>
            <li>Punch down dough and divide in half. Form each half into an oblong shape 3/8 to 1/2 inch thick.</li>
            <li>Brush grill grate with garlic-flavored olive oil.</li>
            <li>Carefully place one piece of dough on the hot grill. Dough will begin to puff almost immediately.</li>
            <li>When the bottom crust has lightly browned, turn dough over using two spatulas.</li>
            <li>Working quickly, brush oil over crust, and then brush with 2 tablespoons tomato sauce.</li>
            <li>Arrange 1/2 cup chopped tomatoes, 1/8 cup sliced black olives, and 1/8 cup roasted red peppers over crust.</li>
            <li>Sprinkle with 1 cup cheese and 2 tablespoons basil. Close the lid, and cook until cheese melts.</li>
            <li>Remove from grill and set aside to cool for a few minutes. Repeat with second piece of dough.</li>
            <li>Enjoy and serve!</li>
        </ol>
